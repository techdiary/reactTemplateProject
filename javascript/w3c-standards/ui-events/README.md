# UI Events

## OverView

UI Events is designed with two main goals. The first goal is the design of an [event](https://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Events/#event) system which allows registration of event listeners and describes event flow through a tree structure. Additionally, the specification will provide standard modules of events for user interface control and document mutation notifications, including defined contextual information for each of these event modules.
