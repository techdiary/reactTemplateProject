### **Function components have several key advantages:**

* They help prevent abuse of the `setState()` API, favoring props instead.
* They encourage the ["smart" vs. "dumb" component pattern](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/smart-and-dumb-components-7ca2f9a7c7d0).
* They encourage code that is more reusable and modular.
* They discourage giant, complicated components that do too many things.
* They allow React to make performance optimizations by avoiding unnecessary checks and memory allocations
